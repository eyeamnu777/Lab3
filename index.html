      <h3>All about Nù.</h3>
      <p id="Bio">Me llama Nù Harley and I only took a couple of classes of Spanish in high school. Always enjoyed school and a garden tool for knowledge. I love the brain and all of its functions. Out of college I started out as a substitute teacher at a local city high school by my school and eventually assisted younger grade levels. I fell for the first graders as I had pessismistic thoughts. A goal I have is to become the most thorough, efficient web developer/coder I work myself to be. Networking is my second highest priority aside from learning code. Lastly, creating a legacy for generations after me.</p>
