      <h3>All about Nù.</h3>
      <p id="Bio">Me llama Nù Harley and I only took a couple of classes of Spanish in high school. Always enjoyed school and a garden tool for knowledge. I love the brain and all of its functions. Out of college I started out as a substitute teacher at a local city high school by my school and eventually assisted younger grade levels. I fell for the first graders as I had pessismistic thoughts. A goal I have is to become the most thorough, efficient web developer/coder I work myself to be. Networking is my second highest priority aside from learning code. Lastly, creating a legacy for generations after me.</p>

  //* Me llama Nù Harley and I only took a couple of classes of Spanish in high school. I am mature for myage; as I
  skipped the 5th grade because I would get dont with my work early and help (bother according to the teacher) other
  students. What's funny is I got in trouble in my junior/senior year of college for overly participating; how funny is
  that. I graduated from The Central State University, a historically black university, with a Bachelor's Degree of
  Science in Psychology and a minor in Business Administration. Always enjoyed school and a garden tool for knowledge. I
  love the brain and all of its functions. Out of college I started out as a substitute teacher at a local city high
  school by my school and eventually assisted younger grade levels. I fell for the first graders as I had pessismistic
  thoughts. First corporate job was with Huntington National Bank as a teller. A goal I have is to become the most
  thorough, efficient web developer/coder I work myself to be. Networking is my second highest priority aside from
  learning code. Lastly, creating a legacy for generations after me. All things Nù.//
